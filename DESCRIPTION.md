### About

Paperless-ngx is an application that manages your personal documents. With the help of a document scanner (see Scanner recommendations),
paperless transforms your wieldy physical document binders into a searchable archive and provides many utilities for finding and managing your documents.

### Why This Exists

Paper is a nightmare. Environmental issues aside, there’s no excuse for it in the 21st century.
It takes up space, collects dust, doesn’t support any form of a search feature, indexing is tedious, it’s heavy and prone to damage & loss.

I wrote this to make “going paperless” easier. I do not have to worry about finding stuff again.
I feed documents right from the post box into the scanner and then shred them. Perhaps you might find it useful too.

### Paperless-ngx

Paperless-ngx forked from paperless-ng to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people.
